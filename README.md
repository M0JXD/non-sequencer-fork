# Non Sequencer Fork

This is a fork of Non-Sequencer, with some small maintenance fixes. 
This is not a serious project and should be considered "life support" as oppose to a serious forking attempt, although PRs (or making your own fork based on this) are welcome.

The differences are:

+ Fixed some compile errors to build for newer C++ standard.
+ Changed to xmake build system.
+ Change instrument directory path.
+ NSM Hide/Show GUI
+ Manually updated "nonlib" to a newer version by Stazed

### Would be nice to do/fix:
+ Some built-in humanisation options.
+ Pure FLTK build, Ã  la Stazed.
+ Fully link against Stazed's FL and nonlib.
+ An end user instrument directory, perhaps ~/.local/share/non-sequencer/instruments
+ Fix some bugs: 
1) If you enter a pattern and the note goes out of bounds of the set of bars, the pattern length gets longer to accomodate, disregarding the set amount of bars and the time signature. This persists even after those notes are removed. To get it back, select a higher amount of bars than the artifical length, then the desired lower amount. (is this a feature or a bug? :/) (This is a carry over from OG Non)
2) If there is a note already to the right of where you want to place one the sequencer might not allow you to place it. To work around this, remove the note(s) to the right, then enter them again afterwards. Alternatively you can choose a shorter note duration to maintain a gap to the right of the entered note. (This is a carry over from OG Non)
3) With the Default intrument, scrolling down can cause the labels to become misaligned. (Can't test in OG Non, see below)
4) Save the window postion

## Reasoning for fork:

I wanted a sequencer to go with Stazed's Non-XT with JACK-MIDI (yes, I'm aware of aj2midi), NSM support, and a filterable "piano roll" for doing drums etc., which Non already has with it's instrument files. There are very few options with all these characteristics. Stazed has no interest in maintaining a non-sequencer fork due to maintaining Seq32/Seq42 which does not have JACK-MIDI. I tried Seq66 but it was way too confusing for me and it's JACK-MIDI implementation was not what I wanted, automatically creating named output ports for other JACK-MIDI clients it detects instead of just providing "Seq66 MIDI Outs". Seq192 is cool but leans more to live performance than arrangements. Even so, I'm not a big fan of the Seq24 piano roll.

The only other options with JACK-MIDI I found are much heavier, those being MuSE (a whole DAW and it's complicated to set up and use) and Hydrogen which can be set up to sequence. I did consider working on Aria Maestosa which had some preliminary JACK support added a while ago, but that was on the other end of the scale being too simplistic. Most everything else (https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/notation_apps, https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/midi_apps) is either the wrong tool or long abandoned. So I decided to go back and try Non.

The .deb on KXStudio refused to pick up instrument files, so I knew I needed to fix that from source. Upon trying to build Non-Sequencer I hit various issues due to outdated waf, not being able to find libraries, and compile errors due to outdated coding standard. So I fixed those issues by porting to build system that shouldn't go out of date as quickly but is still easy to use, and doing some minor code edits.

At the moment I'm weighing up whether to keep working on this, or look at trying to add NSM and better JACK support to something else (I quite like Helio Sequencer), and continuing to use Hydrogen for drums. Or maybe even reviving one of the many abandoned sequencers in the Linux Audio Wiki - I've yet to try/test everything!

Another reason is that I mentioned looking into NTK maintenance for the Non-XT series, so it's worth having some (passing) experience.

## Dependencies (Debian names)
+ NTK (see below)
+ liblo-dev
+ libjack-jackd2-dev
+ libcairo-dev

### Getting NTK
Your distribution may have NTK available from the package manager. 
If not, grab it from Stazed's repo as it has some minor fixes.

### Building
First, ensure the dependencies are available, as well as the xmake build system.
Then simply:

```
xmake
xmake install --admin
```

The included "instruments" folder is no longer in the home directory, but in:
```
/usr/local/share/non-sequencer/instruments
```
